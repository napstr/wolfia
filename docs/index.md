# Game Modes

## Mafia

9+ players

Town ![][t]{:height="15" width="15"} against Mafia ![][m]{:height="15" width="15"}

Power roles:  
The Cop ![][cop]{:height="15" width="15"} investigates the alignment of a player at night.

- The Mafia knows their team
- During the day everyone votes to lynch one of the players
- During the night the Mafia kills players
- Town wins when all Mafia are dead, Mafia wins when they reach parity.


## Popcorn

Village ![][v]{:height="15" width="15"} against Wolves ![][w]{:height="15" width="15"}
- The ![][w]{:height="15" width="15"}s know their team.
- A ![][v]{:height="15" width="15"} holds the ![][gun]{:height="15" width="15"}.
- If the ![][v]{:height="15" width="15"} shoots a ![][w]{:height="15" width="15"}, the ![][w]{:height="15" width="15"} dies and the ![][v]{:height="15" width="15"} can shoot again.
- If the ![][v]{:height="15" width="15"} shoots another ![][v]{:height="15" width="15"}, the shooter dies, and the ![][gun]{:height="15" width="15"} goes to the ![][v]{:height="15" width="15"} that was shot at.
- ![][v]{:height="15" width="15"}s win when all ![][w]{:height="15" width="15"}s are dead, ![][w]{:height="15" width="15"}s win when they reach parity.

### Wild

3+ players

The Wild mode randomizes who gets the ![][gun]{:height="15" width="15"}.
The channel is never be closed, non-players and dead players can post all the time.

### Classic

3-26 players

The Classic mode allows the ![][w]{:height="15" width="15"}s to have a separate hidden chat, where they may decide which ![][v]{:height="15" width="15"} gets the ![][gun]{:height="15" width="15"}.
The game channel is moderated, which means during a game only the living players are allowed to talk in the channel.

# Permissions:

Wolfia requires some permissions to run games flawlessly. It will try to automatically set itself up with what it needs, or ask you to give it the required permissions to do so.

Using the official invite link provided at the top of this page, or by running the `w.help` command to invite Wolfia to your server, will have it request the required permissions. If permissions on your server are broken for Wolfia or the required ones have been updated, kicking and reinviting should restore permissions to a working state.


Nevertheless, and also for the control freaks among us, here is a comprehensive list of what is required and why:


### Required
<dl>
<dt>- Read Message History</dt>
<dd>Edit it's own messages after they have been sent</dd>
<dt>- Use External Emojis</dt>
<dd>The standarized emojis are not enough to display everything clearly, so Wolfia packs a bunch of custom ones</dd>
<dt>- Embed Links</dt>
<dd>Formatting of messages</dd>
<dt>- Add Reactions</dt>
<dd>Display vote counts</dd>
<dt>- Manage Messages</dt>
<dd>Clearing reactions off of votecounts</dd>
<dt>- Manage Roles</dt>
<dd>Moderate the game channel with permission overrides (and just that; Wolfia does not create or delete any roles for the players)</dd>
</dl>

### Optional
<dl>
<dt>- Create Instant Invite</dt>
<dd>Adds invites to the channel where the game is running to role pms and private chat servers which makes for a smooth navigation for players during the game.</dd>
</dl>
