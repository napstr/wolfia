 * Game commands are different from regular commands as they can be registered by games.
 * todo some game commands need to work in private channels
 * todo find a decent way to go from private channel -> game that the command belongs to.
 * todo limiting users to only a single ongoing game is an option, but this happens 95% of the time for when there is a
 * todo broken game / game with bad settings and users just want to start a new one, so stopping them from doing that
